firefish (1.0.3-d2023073000-release) unstable; urgency=medium

Firefish v1.0.3: https://git.joinfirefish.org/firefish/firefish/-/releases/v1.0.3

There are no major differences between v1.0.1 and v1.0.3, but we now host our own code forge at https://git.joinfirefish.org/firefish/firefish, and there's some minor fixes with assets, ratelimits, and caching.
